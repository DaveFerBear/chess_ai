## Notes
* This project requires python 3.6 (3.7 not yet supported by skfuzzy).
* skfuzzy also requires matplotlib, which can pose issues when using virtual environments (python is not installed as a framework).  This [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31373163/anaconda-runtime-error-python-is-not-installed-as-a-framework/41433353) has a working solution.
